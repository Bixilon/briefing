# Brie.fi/ng

<img src="public/sample.jpg" height="200" align="right" style="padding-left: 2rem;"> Privacy is the central idea behind this project. Only open technologies (such as [WebRTC](https://webrtc-security.github.io/)) are used, which work with all modern browsers. Thus, no installation of additional software is required and the approach remains future-proof.

A conversation can be started immediately for free via [Brie.fi/ng](https://brie.fi/ng). A [free iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/app/briefing-video-chat/id1510803601) is also available.

Features such as desktop sharing, text chat and simple invitation links are available. More can be easily added with knowledge of Javascript and Vue.

## Quick start for developers

Download or clone the project to your local machine and you are ready to go:

```sh
npm install
npm run start
```

## Use in your own projects

However, there is also an option to use the app in your own projects. The following options are available:

1. create a room via [Brie.fi/ng](https://brie.fi/ng) and copy the link into your website.
2. embed Briefing via 'frame' into your own site. Use the [handy configurator](https://brie.fi/ng/embed).
3. start Briefing on your own server e.g. [via Docker](docs/docker.md)
4. customize the source code according to your needs. See the [documentation](docs/README.md) for details.

## Licenses

In general Briefing is free, however a [commercial license](#commercial-license) is also available, which I ask you to purchase, especially for "white labeling" applications.
